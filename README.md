# WebBased_SSH
This is WebBased SSH client ,This was my part of company project.
Run this project 

```node server.js``` 


soon as you run the server,server will open default browser where it will run.
Here i used free ssh server for testing purpose,if you want to change.
change it by replacing host,username,password with your desirable ssh credentials.


``` .connect({
          host: "test.rebex.net",
          port: 22,
          username: "demo",
          password: "password",
        });```
